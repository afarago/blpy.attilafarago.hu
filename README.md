**SPIKE to Pybricks – word-block converter to Pybricks Python code**

[blpy.attilafarago.hu](https://blpy.attilafarago.hu) is a web-based tool that converts word-block programming (used in LEGO® SPIKE and similar educational platforms) into Pybricks-compatible Python code. This project provides an easy bridge for those who want to move from block-based to text-based programming with LEGO® robotics.

## Features

- Convert visual word blocks into ready-to-run Pybricks MicroPython code
- Intuitive, user-friendly drag-and-drop interface
- Live code preview for instant feedback
- Supports LEGO® SPIKE and Pybricks platforms
- Designed to help educators, students, and hobbyists transition to Python programming

## Getting Started

Visit the online tool: [https://blpy.attilafarago.hu](https://blpy.attilafarago.hu)

To run locally or contribute, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions in the [README](README.md).

Your README.md already contains a detailed description, but it should be updated to clarify that blocklypy is the functional base/library powering this project.

Here’s the improved description section, emphasizing the blocklypy dependency:
